"""Which venue a rule trades on, who can quote it, and when it is open.

A `Rule` stores a market code. This table is the only place that knows what a
code means: which provider answers for it, what suffix that provider expects on
the symbol, what currency prices come back in, and the venue's trading session.

Keeping it in one table rather than in `if` branches inside the feed matters for
two reasons. Adding a venue is a row, not a code change. And the rule builder
populates its dropdown from here, so the operator can never select a market the
feed cannot actually route.

WHY SESSIONS ARE HERE
---------------------
Quote freshness is meaningless without knowing whether the venue is trading. A
US quote at 02:00 KST is thirteen hours old and perfectly correct — the market
closed. Judging it against a single global bound halted the engine every night.

So each venue carries its trading windows in its own timezone, and the evaluator
asks several questions instead of one:

  * closed right now                  -> skip; a rule cannot execute anyway
  * open, and data is from this session -> apply the tight freshness bound
  * open, but nothing has printed today -> skip; a venue outage, not our own

Windows are a tuple per day, which is what makes lunch breaks expressible: Tokyo
and Hong Kong stop trading for an hour, and treating that gap as "open with
frozen data" would halt the engine every lunchtime.

HOLIDAYS
--------
An earlier build did not enumerate holidays, on the argument that a holiday and
a venue outage are indistinguishable and both skip. That is no longer good
enough: with a real-time feed, an unrecognised holiday means the engine spends
the day reporting "no trade printed" for a market it should have known was
shut, and any freshness reasoning on that day is guesswork.

`core.calendars` therefore carries generated holiday and special-session data
for every venue here, from `exchange_calendars`. `Session` still describes the
regular weekly pattern; `Market.trading_state` combines it with the calendar and
is what callers should use. `Session.is_open` alone would report a public
holiday as open.

Coverage is finite, and a date beyond it reports "unknown" rather than "open".
