"""Ties the engine together and runs it on a background thread.

`EngineRuntime` owns the state machine, the order book, the evaluator and the
quote feed, and exposes the small surface the UI actually needs: arm, disarm,
halt, acknowledge, and a stream of decisions to display.

Design points worth stating:

  * **The loop runs only while armed.** A disarmed engine makes no network
    request. There is no "just polling quietly in the background" state — if
    the dashboard says DISARMED, nothing is happening.

  * **A tick is atomic per rule, not per pass.** Each rule is evaluated, and
    its trigger count persisted, before the next is considered. A crash halfway
    through a pass therefore cannot replay the rules that already fired, since
    their incremented counts are already on disk and the deterministic order id
    would collide.

  * **Everything the operator did not see is still recorded.** Decisions are
    kept in a bounded ring and journalled to disk, so "why did nothing happen
    at 09:31" has an answer after the fact.

  * **The state snapshot is written on every transition**, not on shutdown. A
    process killed while halted must still refuse to arm on next launch.
